=head1 NAME

setup-vote - Create the control files for running a vote

=head1 SYNOPSIS

A vote is started if certain control files exist in the vote/newsgroup
directory. These control files are:

	start_vote.cfg (contains the timestamp of the vote start time)
	endtime.cfg (contains the timestamp of the vote cutoff time)
	posted.cfv ?

This program creates endtime.cfg for the chosen newsgroups
if it does not already exist.
The duration of the vote is taken from the first file found:

	vote/$newsgroup/voteperiod (duration in days)
	config/voteperiod

The automated vote taker can accept a vote as soon as endtime.cfg
exists (it must contain a timestamp later than the current time).

After this program has been run, use mkcfv.pl to create the
pgp-signed Call-For-Votes (CFV) message and post it, so everybody
knows they can vote.
