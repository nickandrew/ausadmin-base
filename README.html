<title>Welcome to the ausadmin software release</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>
You have just unpacked a release of the ausadmin software for USENET
News hierarchy maintenance. If you are not a USENET hierarchy
maintainer, this software may not be much use to you.
</p>

<p>
This software is (C)opyright 1998-2002 by
Nick Andrew &lt;nick@nick-andrew.net&gt;
and is released under the terms of the GNU General Public License (GPL).
</p>

<p>
To install and configure this software, follow these instructions in
the order they appear.
</p>

<h1>Setting up</h1>

<p>
These instructions are minimal, because this software is alpha quality only!

<h2>Setup the environment</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Install necessary software: apache-ssl, cronolog, ssh, rsync, pgp, gnupg
 <li>Create an 'ausadmin' userid and group, and su to ausadmin
 <li>Edit .profile or .bashrc to add $HOME/bin to your PATH
 <li>Unpack the ausadmin software release under ausadmin's home directory
 <li>Setup your apache webserver to serve the website. See doc/apache.conf
 <li>Unpack the ausadmin website release under your website DocumentRoot
</ol>

<h2>Import your hierarchy data</h2>

<ol>
 <li>su to ausadmin
 <li>umask 027
 <li>mkdir -p data/Newsgroups
 <li>mkdir -p vote
 <li>copy your raw "newsgroups" type file to data/ausgroups (yes, that's the name it has to be at this time)
 <li>do "bin/gen-initial-newsgroups.pl data/ausgroups" to create and populate the data/Newsgroups directories. Just ignore the RCS messages.
 <li>You have now completed 10% of the setting up!
 <li>Next, find your charter files (one charter per newsgroup). Make sure the
charter files are "clean" (i.e. no email headers or leftover rationale from group proposal time).
 <li>For each charter file:
  <ol>
   <li>Do "bin/set-charter.pl newsgroup.name charter.file". Just ignore the RCS messages.
  </ol>
 <li>You have now completed 90% of the setting up!
</ol>

<h2>Create templates</h2>

<p>The "data" directory contains the definitive list of newsgroups in
the data/Newsgroups directory, the definitive group descriptions (at
least at the moment) in data/ausgroups and some generated files.
</p>

<p>
Samples for all templates are available in the samples/ directory.
<ol>
 <li>Copy samples/* into config/
 <li>Edit each template for your situation and/or language. See below
     for the list of templates and what they are for.
</ol>
</p>

<p>The templates are:
<table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0">
 <tr>
  <th>Filename</th>
  <th>Description</th>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>booster.template</td>
  <td>
   This is a perl string expression which is eval()ed by the code, so it
   must start with " and end with " on a line by itself. See bin/Newsgroup.pm
   to find out what variable substitutions are allowed.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>checkgroups.footer</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file which is prepended to the generated checkgroups
   message, default is empty.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>checkgroups.header</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file which is appended to the generated checkgroups
   message, default is empty.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>faq.header</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file containing an article header to be used when
   posting the regular FAQ.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>grouplist.footer</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file which is appended to the human-readable group list
   message.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>grouplist.header</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file which is prepended to the human-readable group list
   message.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>vote-check.msg</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file containing an email header and body which is sent
   by the vote checker program, to look for invalid email addresses
   on votes received.
  </td>
 </tr>

 <tr>
  <td>voter-check.msg</td>
  <td>
   This is a text file containing an email header and body which is sent
   by the voter address checking program, to look for invalid email addresses
   on votes received. Yes, this is slightly different from the above file.
  </td>
 </tr>

<h2>Setup PGP and GnuPG private and public keys </h2>

<p>
The software uses PGP 2.6.3(i) to sign control messages, and GnuPG to
sign ordinary text files, such as RFDs, vote results, etc.
</p>

<p>
You will therefore need to have your public and private keys inserted into
<ul>
 <li>$HOME/.pgp/pubring.pgp and $HOME/.pgp/secring.pgp
 <li>$HOME/.gnupg/pubring.gpg and $HOME/.gnupg/secring.gpg
</ul>
I can't help with this process, sorry. I had problems getting my very old
PGP 2.x key to be recognised by GnuPG, but eventually it worked.
</p>

<h2>Generate checkgroups and grouplist messages</h2>

<ol>
 <li>Do "bin/gen-checkgroups.pl". The generated checkgroups is derived from the contents of data/ausgroups and data/Newsgroups subdirectories.
 <li>Do "bin/gen-grouplist.pl". Ironically, the generated grouplist is derived from your original "data/ausgroups" file. So make sure it is up-to-date!
</ol>

<h2>Setup vote-taker</h2>

<p>
The ausadmin software uses the email address:
&lt;vote@aus.news-admin.org&gt;
to accept email votes on proposals. You will need to use a different
address.  Set up your system so that emailed votes to your chosen address
are piped to "bin/incoming" (not "bin/incoming.pl").
</p>

<h2>Jump and pray</h2>

<p>The above may get you started with the ausadmin software. There is
more work to do before you can start running votes however.
</p>

<p>
Firstly, there are many ausadmin-specific assumptions hardcoded into the
source code. Things like email addresses, hostnames, home directories
and domain names. You will need to search and modify these references.
If you can remove these assumptions, for example by moving them out to
a config file in the config/ directory, then ausadmin will greatly
appreciate receiving a patch.
</p>

<p>
Secondly, you will need to learn the names of files in the vote directories
and the meaning of their contents. Each proposal or vote has its own
directory under vote/ and the files in that directory are created and
modified as the vote proceeds.
</p>

<p>
The source code is starting to use the word "proposal" rather than vote.
A proposal starts out as an RFD, (Request For Discussion), which is
constructed from a source file which is received by ausadmin or
created by ausadmin. See "Faq/RFD-template.txt" on the website for
the file structure. This file is parsed by "bin/parse-rfd.pl" to
create a new Proposal in the vote/ subdirectory.
See, for example, "bin/make-rfd.pl" and "bin/setup-vote".
</p>

<p>
An RFD is posted, and discussed, and may become a proper vote after some
time. In that case a CFV (Call For Votes) is created from the proposal
information and posted. As soon as a CFV is created, the system is
ready to receive votes.
See, for example, "bin/mkcfv.pl".
</p>

<p>
Accepted votes are appended to a tally file until the vote completes.
After the voting time limit is reached, there are various tools for
analysing the messages to detect forgeries and multiple voting. Look
for example at "bin/analyse-messages.pl".
</p>

<p>
Once the vote tally is confirmed, there are tools for counting the
vote and creating control messages. See, for example, "bin/genresult.pl"
</p>

<h2>Bugs</h2>

<p>
There is an issue with PGP-signing checkgroups and control messages. If
there is a passphrase on the PGP keys (which there should be) ,
then automatic signing of these messages is not possible. This is not
good for regular automated posting. I haven't found a way around this
security/convenience trade-off yet.
</p>

<h2>The Easy Way (yes, you want this)</h2>

<p>
Now that I have scared you with a lot of scripts which you need to know
how to use to do things, I can tell you that it is actually a lot
easier. There are two tools which you will use all the time. They
are "todo.pl" and "action".
</p>

<p>
"bin/todo.pl" examines every proposal under the vote/ directory and
determines if you need to do something to advance the proposal. Recall
that proposals start empty, then become RFDs, then CFV, then get
voted upon, eventually produce a result, and maybe go to generate a
newgroup message. There are necessary time
delays in all parts of this process, and it is the hardest thing
to remember which proposals are ready for which next stage of the
process. "todo.pl" helps with this by printing a list of the
proposals which are ready for you to make some change. For
example:
</p>

<pre>
ausadmin@slim:~$ todo.pl
aus.sport.touch ... In discussion, wait until 2002-06-06 (rfd/posted)
aus.music.regurgitator ... In discussion, wait until 2002-05-26 (rfd/posted)
aus.business ... In discussion, wait until 2002-06-02 (rfd/posted)
</pre>

<p>
This output says that the current state of each of the three proposals
is "rfd/posted" (i.e. it's being discussed and the RFD has been posted)
and the minimum timeframe for the discussion ends on the listed date.
</p>

<p>
The other very useful tool is "action". Action goes through each of the
proposals in the vote/ directory and determines the proposal's current
state. Depending on the current state, "action" knows what the next
state in the process should be, and it knows what commands to issue
to move the proposal forward. So "action" runs "setup-vote", "mkcfv.pl"
and the other scary commands mentioned in the previous section.
</p>

<p>
"action" prompts you before doing each action. I usually only allow
"action" to make one change at a time, and in the middle of each
action I check the files in the vote/proposal_name directory
to make sure that they are correct (correctly signed, correctly
generated, etc...).
</p>

<h1>Big TODO list for the ausadmin software</h1>

<ul>
<li>Generate messages (e.g. RFD and CFV) from templates as
much as possible. This will help others to translate the
software into other languages.
<li>Provide increased web-based functionality. For example,
show all information about past completed proposals, whether
they passed or failed, what revisions the proposals went
through.
<li>Maintain more data about the newsgroups, for example the
date of creation and who did the creation (maybe the control
message itself). This is especially useful for "grandfathered"
groups, i.e. groups which were created by somebody else before
you started in this role.
<li>Provide web-based submission of proposals. Proposers should
be able to type in and edit their proposal online.
<li>Move to a "reviewer panel" management structure rather than
a single person. Having multiple people review submissions will
provide some checks to keep the reviewers honest, and may reduce
delays in getting proposals posted. It may be possible to have
several reviewers and assign different privilege levels such that
newbie reviewers are able to assist with proposal grammar and
justification but are not able to officially accept proposals
for discussion or voting.
<li>Provide web-based voting rather than email voting. In some
ways, it is harder to submit multiple web votes than it is to
submit multiple email votes. A "registered user" arrangement
with an SSL web server voting site should be able to discourage
all but the most persistent attempts at stuffing the ballot box.
<li>Cleanup the code, remove obsolete source files, move to a
consistent naming standard for commands and files
<li>Reduce the number of commands which need to be executed
from the command line. This may be accomplished by providing
more web-based control functions.
<li>Remove all the "aus" and ausadmin specific assumptions from
the code.
</ul>


<h1>The End</h1>

<p>
This is the end of the setup instructions.
There is some documentation under the doc/ directory also.
