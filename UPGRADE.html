<h1>You have to do these things when upgrading Ausadmin</h1>

<p>
This HTML document contains a sequence of steps which should be
performed when upgrading ausadmin software, to ensure (at least)
that the newsgroup data is in the format required for the software.
In other words, if there is a data structure change between two
releases, this document will contain instructions on making that
change which is necessary before running the newer version.
</p>

<p>
Follow the instructions from top to bottom.
</p>

<h2>Upgrade from 20020521 initial release</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  Move data/booster.template to config/booster.template
 </li>
 <li>
  Check bin/pgp-sign, I added default signer email address
 </li>
 <li>
  Might have to "rm -f vote/*/state" because states were not being
  recalculated correctly.
 </li>
 <li>
  I decided to stop using state files altogether. Basically keeping
  the state in a file doesn't work when the state is time-dependent, such
  as when a vote was started and it might have finished already. So please
  delete all state files.
 </li>
 <li>
  I wrote bin/fix-unsigned-control.pl to add a signed control file
  for all vote directories which have control.msg but not control.signed.
  You probably won't have any, but just in case, run this script to
  fix up.
 </li>
 <li>
  In the next release I am going to take a lot of config information
  out of the one-line text files and put it into XML using XML::Simple.
  So you need to install XML::Simple (debian package libxml-simple-perl).
  I will write a config file converter.
 </li>
</ul>

<h2>Upgrade from 20020804 release</h2>

<ul>
 <li>
  Run bin/fix-vote-result shell script to create a vote_result file
  for all votes which have been completed. vote_result will be used
  for the calculation of vote state, particularly 'vote/fail'.
 </li>
 <li>
  Scripts now use the environment variable <b>$AUSADMIN_HOME</b> in
  place of <b>$HOME</b>. It means you can place your ausadmin data
  structure somewhere other than your home directory (good for me, for
  testing). You will need to ensure that you set this environment variable
  in your shell (edit <b>.bashrc</b> for example) and make sure that it
  is set in cron jobs also.
 </li>
 <li>
  Move data/checkgroups.header to config/checkgroups.header
 </li>
 <li>
  Move data/checkgroups.footer to config/checkgroups.footer
 </li>
 <li>
  Delete data/ausgroups.html if it exists.
 </li>
 <li>
  Run bin/fix-signed-cfv-filename.pl to rename all "posted.cfv" files in
  vote directories to "cfv.signed". This is to start to get some
  consistency in file naming. PGP-signed files names will always end in
  ".signed" in future. You will also need to upgrade the ausadmin-website
  package to a version on or after 20020808.
 </li>
 <li>
  Do "rm -rf CFV". The CFV directory was a bad idea because the symlinks
  in that directory become invalid when the vote is renamed. Sure I could
  adjust the symlinks, but the information is in the vote directory anyway.
 </li>
</ul>
