Creating a New Vote
-------------------

A shell script called "mkvote" is included in the bin directory and is
used to create new votes.

usage: mkvote new-newsgroup-name charter-info

"charter-info" is the FULL path name to a file containing the following
information:

----[Sample charter-info file]----
Proposer: First Last <email@address>
Moderated: unmoderated|moderated
Newsgroup: aus.newsgroup.name
Line: newsgroup line description

Charter: 
blah to EOF
----[End file]----

The script creates the CFV file, posts the CFV to appropriate newsgroups,
creates the directory structure for the vote and a config file with the
vote end time in seconds.
