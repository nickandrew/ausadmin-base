Todo ... vote counting for aus.sport.pro-wrestling and aus.sport.golf

1 - rename messages - put filename in tally.dat I think, is easiest,
after the timestamp. Looks like incoming/incoming.pl/collater.pl is
already doing this. But it's broken, due to DF's stupid coding
practices!

	fix-tally-path.pl fixes this

2 - when the vote result is posted, it should be like this:

	valid votes

	  x # domain
	  ...

	the following votes are believed to have been made by the same
	person (i.e. multi-voting), so have not been counted in the result:

	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)
	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)
	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)

	(blank line between groups)

	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)
	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)
	  yyyy-mm-dd  ip-addr   from-line(s/@/ # /)

3 - we need a way to mark a vote as valid or invalid without obscuring its
intent - so the tally file gets another column, containing
one of:

	OKAY
	FORGE
	MULTI-nnnnnnnnn
	NEW		(means not analysed)

	done - fix-tally-status.pl does this

4 - When analysing received headers, the basic info we pull out is one or
more of:

	src-ip-address
	src-helo-name		(i.e. what they said after HELO)
	src-ident-string	(i.e. the response to an ident query)
	src-some-hostname	(unknown whether it is from DNS or helo)

Then:

src-ip-address is xrefed against other ip addresses (e.g. in
X-Sender-IP header).

src-helo-name is xrefed against itself

src-ident-string is xrefed against itself (even if it says "root")

src-some-hostname is xrefed against itself and also hostnames from email
addresses and any other hostnames in the message

5 - Scoring

We do want to find the messages which are most likely to be fakes first.
After a set of messages is found which has some common property (e.g. same
IP address) then all other common properties are found for that same set
of messages. e.g.

ip: a.b.c.d
	messages: 1 2 3 4

message set: 1, 2, 3, 4
	common properties:
		ip   1, 2, 3, 4
		sender-domain=XXX 1, 3
		mailer=YYY 1, 2, 4

	score for this set = 9 ?
	score for msgs = [3, 2, 2, 2]
