<p>
This is a quick list of the main commands to use with ausadmin:

<ol>
<li><tt>new-rfd newsgroup-name rfd-file</tt>
<p>
Creates a <i>vote/newsgroup</i> directory for the newsgroup,
parses the RFD file and writes each component into a separate file in that
directory.

<li><tt>mkvote newsgroup-name</tt>
<p>
Sets up the vote using the current defaults for <i>voterule</i> and
<i>voteperiod</i> and writes the vote control files into the newsgroup's
directory.
<p>
Then it creates the CFV message, signs it and posts it to the distribution
list from the RFD.

<li><tt>gennewgroup.pl</tt>
<li><tt>genresult.pl newsgroup-name</tt>
<p>Counts the votes for the group and generates a result message.
</ol>

<h1>Other useful commands</h1>
<ul>
<li>parse-rfd.pl - break an RFD into its components. Dies if there's a
problem or something missing. I'm going to extend it so it can write
its stuff to somewhere other than vote/ and then people can use it
to check their RFD submissions.

<li>setup-vote - Create just the control files for a vote, not the CFV
<li>mkcfv.pl - Create just the signed CFV, do not post it. Requires that
setup-vote has been run first.
</ul>

<p>
I'm also going to modify sign-aus-post.pl so that it operates non-interactively,
so one can make a standard article, e.g.

<pre>
	cat <<EOF >art.$$
	Subject: A test post
	From: ausadmin@aus.news-admin.org
	Newsgroups: aus.test

	This is a test post
	EOF

	sign-aus-post.pl < art.$$ | post.pl
</pre>

And obviously, only the body of the article will be signed. This will
remove complexity from anything which needs to post PGP-signed text.
