<p>
<h1>Overview of the process</h1>
This is the process which ausadmin follows, from start to finish. The
components of the process are:

<ol>
<li>Receive email from users and reply with prompt, accurate advice
<li>Decide whether suggested newsgroup names are acceptable
<li>Receive RFD from proponent, store online and post RFD
<li>Update newsgroup info from proponent
<li>Create Call-For-Votes (CFV) and post
<li>Check vote tally for forgeries, remove all forgeries
<li>Create final result message and post
<li>Issue newgroup messages for groups which passed their vote
</ol>

<h1>Receive email from users</h1>
<p>
Users have been told to send email to ausadmin@aus.news-admin.org.
This address is forwarded according to the instructions in
~ausadmin/.qmail-ausadmin.

<p>
When you reply to a message, set your From address to
<ausadmin@aus.news-admin.org> so that any replies will
go to that address.

<h1>Decide whether suggested newsgroup names are appropriate</h1>

<p>
The basic rules to use here are:
<ol>
<li>Is the newsgroup name valid?
<p>
Valid groups contain only the letters a-z, the numbers 0-9 and the dash -
between each component of the newsgroup name. The length of each component
should be 14 characters or less (although this is no longer mandatory, it
is preferred).

<li>Is there already an aus.* newsgroup which discusses substantially
the same topic?

<li>Does the group's immediate parent exist, or does a sibling exist?
<p>
Ausadmin will only create groups where a parent group already
exists or other groups already exist which have the same (missing)
parent group.
<p>
(This rule doesn't apply for 2nd-level groups, e.g. aus.history).
For example, somebody suggests aus.sport.tennis.umpires. Does the
group aus.sport.tennis exist? Alternately, do other subgroups (e.g.
aus.sport.tennis.coaches) exist?

<li>Does the topic of the parent of the proposed newsgroup include the
topic suggested?
<p>
The topics discussed by newsgroups are supposed to become more specific
at lower levels, so if a parent group already exists, its topic should
be more general than the topic of the proposed new group.

<li>If the newsgroup is a 2nd-level group, is the topic of sufficient
generality or wide interest?
<p>
2nd-level newsgroups (aus.something) should be about quite general,
fundamental topics. Good examples of this are science, history,
sport, politics.

<li>Is the topic too specific?
<p>
As a newsgroup hierarchy deepens, topics should become more specific,
but not radically so. For example, aus.sport.cricket.shane-warne is
probably too specific. To approve that name would imply that every
cricketer, past and present, deserves their own newsgroup.

</ol>

<p>
If a proposal passes all these tests, it is probably ready to go to
the RFD stage.

<h1>Receive RFD from proponent, store online and post RFD</h1>

<p>
The RFD is a text document with certain required sections. These are:

<ul>
<li>proposer - the name and email address of the person driving this activity
<li>distribution - the list of related newsgroups
<li>charter - the proposed rules for the group
<li>rationale - the justification for creating the group
<li>ngline - the 1-line description for peoples' newsgroups file
<li>modinfo (opt) - contact name and address for the moderator, if any
</ul>

<p>
When the RFD is received by E-mail, store it using this command:
<pre>
		new-rfd newsgroup-name rfd-file
</pre>

<p>
<i>new-rfd</i> will parse the RFD into its component sections (and
die with an error message if anything important is missing) and store
them in the newly-created vote/newsgroup directory. At this point
the RFD will be listed on the aus.news-admin.org website as being
"in discussion".

<p>
Examine the files in the vote/newsgroup directory to be sure that
the RFD has been parsed correctly.

<p>
Do the following to post the RFD:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Edit the vote/newsgroup/rfd file and set Subject, From and Newsgroups
headers:
<pre>
Subject: RFD (Request For Discussion): newsgroup-name
From: ausadmin@aus.news-admin.org
Newsgroups: the comma-separated list of groups in the distribution
</pre>
<li>Post the RFD with <tt>bin/post.pl < vote/newsgroup/rfd</tt>
</ol>


<h1>Update newsgroup info from proponent</h1>

<p>
The 21 day discussion period may evoke some changes required to the
original proposal. Accept any changes from the proponent, update the
RFD (and re-parse it using <tt>bin/parse-rfd.pl</tt>). If large changes
occurred it might be worthwhile to re-post the RFD.

<h1>Create Call-For-Votes (CFV) and post</h1>

<p>
If you want to add your own note to the CFV, put it in
<i>vote/newsgroup/cfv-notes.txt</i> before doing the following
step.

<p>
This script sets up the vote, creates and PGP-signs and posts the CFV:
<pre>
	mkvote newsgroup-name
</pre>

<p>
Check the CFV to ensure that you posted the right thing (if not, oops,
too late!)
<p>
Now there's nothing to do but sit back and wait until the vote finishes.

<h1>Check vote tally for forgeries, remove all forgeries</h1>
<p>
I need to get an update from DF on how he detects forgeries.

<h1>Create final result message and post</h1>
<p>
I haven't got this far yet.

<h1>Issue newgroup messages for groups which passed their vote</h1>
<p>
I haven't got this far yet. It's probably like the old instructions:
<pre>
gennewgroup.pl newsgroup-name
</pre>
